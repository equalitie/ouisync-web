    "faqContent70": "When sharing a repository, you can decide to share it with **Blind** permission.", 
    "faqContent71": "This means that it can be imported into another device, but it cannot be read or edited or viewed on that device - it is **blind** on that device.  Its purpose is simply to securley store data on a device.",

    "faqTitle71": " Why is it called Secure Data Storage and  not simply Data Backup? ",
    "faqContent711": "Typically, if you want to back up your data, the backups would be created by some utility program, and they would be timestamped.  Thus, if you needed to, you would be able to go back to the previous backed up version. ",

    "faqContent20d10": "_Note: If you have previously used Ouisync or other applications that rely on BitTorrent DHT and Peer Exchange for peer discovery and data exchange (which P2P applications often do),then your IP address may be ‘remembered’ by the DHT for awhile even after you stop using those applications. _",
    "faqContent20d11": "_This means that If you initially share your Ouisync repositories via internet, and you have the BitTorrent DHT ON, DHT may remember that IP address for awhile even if you then switch the BitTorrent DHT setting off and only share your Ouisync within your local network, or directly to a peer’s IP address._",
    "faqContent20d12": "_This ‘remembering’ is a normal feature of the BitTorrent DHT design to speed the peer discovery within the P2P applications, and if your IP address becomes inactive within the DHT (ie you are not using any applications that rely on it), eventually the DHT will ‘forget’ your IP address and drop it from its lookup tables._",
    
    "faqTitle20e": "Why can I not connect directly to my peer’s IP address? ",
    "faqContent20e1": "The ability of your device to connect directly to your peer’s device via their IP address depends on many things outside the Ouisync app’s control.  This could be your Internet Service provider, your device’s NAT settings, firewall settings, your router and so on.",
    "faqContent20e2": "Connectivity is best when your NAT type is Endpoint Independent (this is usually set by your Internet Service Provider and, as a user, you cannot change it). ",

    "faqTitle20f": "Where can I find my IP address and the port number?",
    "faqContent20f1": "Your IP address and your port number are available on your Ouisync app Settings screen.  Please look up the External IPv4 entry.  Underneath it you will see both your IP address and the port number.",
    "faqContent20f2": "When you want to add a peer manually, these are the numbers you need to enter into the Add peer window. ",

    "faqTitle20g": "Can Ouisync app work with VPN tools?", 
    "faqContent20g1": "Yes.  We test the Ouisync app using VPNs and are able to sync data between devices that use VPNs and between those ones and the ones that don’t use them.",
    "faqContent20g2": "We cannot guarantee that Ouisync app will work with every VPN solution out there, so if you are not able to use is with your VPN solution, please let us know and we’ll try to help. ",
    "faqContent20g3": "In future releases, to further increase the user’s privacy and security, we will endeavour to further annonymise the user’s IP addresses for users who don’t regularly use the VPNs.  ", 
    
    
    "faqTitle21": "How can I sync files with my peers or with my other devices without internet?",
    "faqContent210": "In situations with limited internet availability, you will need to make sure some means of connecting to other devices still exists. ",
    "faqContent211": "This could be a WiFi signal available to all devices that want to share **Ouisync** _**repositories**_, or it could be intranet, a local network or similar technologies.",
    "faqContent212": "Currently _**repositories**_ cannot be shared via Bluetooth. This feature is planned for future releases.",

    "faqSectionTitle4": "Error messages and Troubleshooting", 
    "faqTitle22": "Why do I see the red dot next to the Settings icon in my Ouisync app?", 
    "faqContent2201": "Red dot represents a warning to the user that some kind of user action is needed.", 
    "faqContent2202": "Here is what can happen:", 
    "faqContent2203": "On Windows - Dokan is missing",
    "faqContent2204": "This red dot can be seen on the Windows version if Dokan is not installed.  See the Dokan  chapter for installation instructions.  Once Dokan is installed, the red dot disappears. ",
    "faqContent2205": "If you chose to skip the Dokan installation, the red dot will persist, and you will see this message: “Accessing repositories via File Explorer is not available”.  This message and the red dot will disappear when you install Dokan.", 
    "faqContent2206": "On any device - New Version is available",
    "faqContent2207": "The same red dot can also be a warning that there is a newer version of app available and that the version you have might not be able to sync the data with this newer version. ",
    "faqContent2208": "This happens rarely.  Normally, if a new version of the app is available it can sync well with the previous versions. ",
    "faqContent2209": "However, from time to time, we need to upgrade the protocols used for data transport.  When this happens, the app detects when two peers use different versions of protocol, and then it gives the users this warning. ",
    "faqContent2210": "If you see the red dot and this warning, please install the latest version of the app.", 

    "faqTitle23": "Why do I see the orange dot next to the Settings icon in my Ouisync app?", 
    "faqTitle2301": "In the version 0.8.2 we have introduced a new default for the settings **sync while using mobile data**. In earlier versions the default was ON, but now it is OFF.",
    "faqTitle2302": "When you want your data to sync with your peers over the internet, please change this settings to ON.", 

    "faqTitle24": "Warnings on Linux", 
    "faqContent2401": "Due to specific ways that Linux uses to handle the files, in this operating system, each Ouisync repository is mounted as a separate drive.  ",
    "faqContent2402": "Note: This is different on Windows, where the Ouisync app mounts as one O:/ drive. In Windows OS there is one Ouisync drive and each repository is repesented as a folder within the file explorer, and on Linux, there is one drive for each repository. ",
    "faqContent2403": "The difference is due to different ways in which these two operating systems handle files via their respecitve file explorers.",
    "faqContent2404": "But back to Linux... When the app is closed cleanly, ie by going to the system tray and right-clicking on Exit, all these repositories are unmounted and not visible in the file explorer", 
    "faqContent2405": "When the app is restarted the next time, all of them are mounted again and their contents can be viewed from the app itself as well as from the Linux file explorer. ",
    "faqContent2406": "But if something unexpected happens, and the repositories are not unmounted properly, then the app may display warnings to the user:",
    "faqContent2407": "If this happens, the user might still see these repositories in the file explorer.",
    "faqContent2408": "When those warning triangles next to each repository are displayed, the repository contens are not accessible, either via the app itself or via the file epxlorer.  ", 
    "faqContent2409": "To rectify the situation, the user needs exit the app from the system tray", 
    "faqContent2410": "and then go to the file explorer, click on the ‘eject’ button next to each repository to unmount them manually. ",
    "faqContent2411": "Then they can restart the app and display and acess the repositories in the normal way.",   

    "faqTitle25": "Upgrade and Downgrade",
    "faqContent251": "We, in the Ouisync team regularly release new versions of the app.  Our software is available in Googleplaystore, Microsoft App Store,  and soon will be in the Apple stores as well.  On top of that, we also make it available via our github repository.",
    "faqContent252": "If you install, for example a Windows version from the Microsoft app store, and when you want to upgrade it, you download a new version from our github repository... Your upgrade is not going to work. ",
    "faqContent253": "You will, in effect, have two different Ouisync apps running on your windows machine and this can give rise to some conflicts.",
    "faqContent254": "The reason for this is that each platform signs the software they distribute, and because of these different signatures, the operating system will treat the two versions as two different apps. ",
    "faqContent255": "There will be two Ouisync icons on your desktop, and the two instances will be able to run in parallel which can give rise to some conflicts. If that happens, please uninstall the ‘upgraded’ version, and run the upgrade from the same platform where the original app version was installed from.",
    "faqContent256": "Equally, if you first install the your Android Ouisync app from the Google play store, and then you want to install a version from the github, the Android installation will fail.  ",
    "faqContent257": "To be able to upgrade the Ouisync app correctly, we recommend to always use the software from the platform that you used for your first installation. ",
    "faqContent258": "Downgrades are not supported. ",

    "faqTitle26": "What happens to my Ouisync data if I uninstall the app? ",
    "faqContent261": "If you uninstall your Ouisync app on Android, the data you had in your Ouisync repositories will also be deleted.  If you have shared your repositories with another device or a peer, they will be able to generate the QR code or link for you and you’ll be able to reimport the same repositories. ",
    "faqContent262": "On Windows, uninstalling Ouiysnc  by going to Programs > Uninstall does not delete the previously existing repositories.  If you wish to delete them, you need to do that by going to the file explorer, finding them on your hard drive, and deleting them from there. ",

    "faqTitle27": "My file explorer doesn’t display all repositories on Windows (of Linux) - what can I check?",
    "faqContent271": "- Please verify that the repository that you want to access via file explorer is unlocked. Locked repositories may not be displayed or may not be accessible via file explorer on Windows or LInux machines.",
    "faqContent272": "- Please check what access right you have for each repository.  Blind repositories may not be displayed in file exporer, but read repositories will allow you to view the files they contain and write will allow you to add, delete, rename or move files.", 
        
    "faqTitle28": "I cannot see my repositories in the file explorer in my Windows computer - what can I do? ",
    "faqContent281": "If youhave installed both the Ouisync app and the Dokan software that the app needs, and you still cannot see your repositories in the File explorer, please try to reboot your Windows machine.  Sometimes this is necessary for the Dokan parameters to be taken into account by the Windows operating system."
