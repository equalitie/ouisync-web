    "faqContent2a1": "Yes. You can do that by going to **repository settings** screen and tapping on the **Delete** button.",
    "faqTitle2b": "What happens to the contents when I delete a repository?", 
    "faqContent2b1": "When you delete a _**repository**_ on your device, this deletion is not propagated to your peer’s devices – they will still have all their _**repositories**_. ",
    "faqContent2b2": "If you delete a _**repository**_ that you have **not shared** with any other device or peer, then your Ouisync data is deleted. ",

    "faqContent30a": "Whether you decide to do it depends on the sensitivity of data that you store in _**Ouisync repositories**_ and habitual usage of your devices.",
    "faqContent30b": "For storing and sharing photos of your cat, maybe a **password** is not necessary.  But for storing more sensitive personal data, we recommend setting up the **password (or biometrics) protection**.",
    
    "faqTitle3a": "How can I add local password for a repository?",
    "faqContent3a1": "You can add **local password** to a _**respository**_ at the time of creation or import by selecting the **Use local password** option. ",

    "faqTitle3e": "What happens if I lose my repository password?",
    "faqContent3e01": "The first thing to know is that wWe don’t store your passwords, and because Ouisync is a peer-to-peer app,there isn’t a mechanism to reset your password that you may be used to in apps that have central servers. ",
    "faqContent3e02": "There are a few different scenarios that may play out if you lose or forget your password.", 
    "faqContent3e03": "Losing the password for a _**repository**_ that you shared with your peers", 
    "faqContent3e04": "If you lose a password, it can happen that you are not able to unlock the _**repository**_ that you previously locked. ",
    "faqContent3e05": "The simplest thing you can do in this case is to delete the repository and import it again from your peers, if their repositories have permissions that you require.  ", 
    "faqContent3e06": "However, if you wold prefer to avoid unecessary network traffic, instead of re-importing the repository, you can [reset the access type for it](#modify-access).",   
    "faqContent3e07": "When you try to tap the Unlock button, or when you want to enter the repository security page, the app will present a dialog box for you to enter the password. ",
    "faqContent3e08": "Of course, if you have lost your password, you won't be able to enter it.  Instead, you can tap the blue link “_I don’t have a local password for this **repository**_”.  This will open the [Reset _**repository**_ access screen](#modify-access). ",
    "faqContent3e09": "If you have shared the _**repository**_ in question, you can ask your peers to resend you the link so you can complete the reset procedure. If you need help, our step by step guide is available in this [section](#modify-access).", 
    "faqContent3e10": "Once you complete that process, your _**repository**_ access will be reset, and there will be no password set for it.  You can set it up again, or you can use your _**repository**_ without the password protection.",
    "faqContent3e11": "Losing a password for a _**repository**_ that you didn’t share, but you have generated and stored its write link",
    "faqContent3e12": "If you lose the password for a _**repository**_ that you did not share with others, but you have generated and stored its **write** link, you can use that link to reset the _**repository**_ access in the same way as described above.",
    "faqContent3e13": "Losing a password that you didn’t share and for which you have not generated and stored a link", 
    "faqContent3e14": "And, finally, if you lose a password for a _**repository**_ that you did not share with others and for which you did not previously generate and store the link, you may lose the access to the Ouisync data in that _**repository**_.",

    "faqContent3f1": "No.",  
    "faqContent3f2": "The peer who is sharing a _**repository**_ can protect their own replica by their own password, and the peer who is importing that _**repository**_ can protect their own replica, on their device, with their own password.",
   
    "faqTitle3g": "How can I change a password for one repository? ",
    "faqContent3g1": "This can be done in the **Security screen** of your _**repository**_.  To get there, go into _**repository**_ **settings** and then **Security** option.",
    "faqContent3g2": "In the fields provided you can type and retype the new password, then tap **Update**.",
    
    "faqTitle3h": "How can I delete a password for one repository?",
    "faqContent3h1": "**Local password** can be deleted in the _**repository**_ **Security screen**, by moving the **Use local password** toggle to **OFF** position.",
    
    "faqTitle4": "Why is it called 'local password' and not simply 'password'?",
    "faqContent40": "A **local password** is a password set up only for your own device. You don't need to share it with your peers. They can set up their own passwords to protect the shared **Ouisync** _**repositories**_ on their own devices.",
    "faqContent41": "This is different to what you may be used to.  For example, if you want to share a word document with a friend, and that document is password protected, you will need to give your friend the password so they can open the document you shared.", 
    "faqContent42": "But in the case of the **Ouisync** _**repositories**_, what gives a user access to a _**repository**_ is not the password, but the **link** shared. ",
    "faqContent43": "The purpose of **password protection** is to prevent access to the **Ouisync** _**repositories**_ if your device falls into the hands of undesired third parties. ",
    "faqContent44": "If you set up the **password protection** and you lock your **Ouisync** _**repositories**_, if any third party gains access to your device they won't be able to share your _**repositories**_ with anybody else.",
    "faqContent45": "Or rather, they are able to share it only with **Blind** permission, which means that they cannot access your data.",
    "faqContent46": "If you don't have the **password (or biometrics) protection**, and your _**repositories**_ are not locked, then any third party that gains access to your device can also access your data and share it or modify it.",
    "faqContent47": "In summary: **Ouisync passwords** protect _**repositories**_ on one device - and to protect the **Ouisync** contents **passwords** need to be set up on each device.", 
    
    "faqTitle4a": "Can I secure my repositories using Biometrics?",
    "faqContent4a1": "Yes. On Android devices that have **Biometric protection** set up, you can use it to secure your _**Ouisync repositories**_ and to enter _**repository**_ **Security screen**. ",
    "faqContent4a2": "When you set up the **biometric protection**, you will need to use it every time you want to unlock a locked _**repository**_, or when you want to enter the _**repository**_ **security** page. ",
    "faqContent4a3": "At present, this option is not available for desktop devices.",
    "faqContent4a4": "Ouisync utilises only fingerprints – implementation of face recognition is on our roadmap.",
    
    "faqTitle4b": "Can I switch off the Biometric protection of the Security screen? ",
    "faqContent4b1": "When **Biometric protection** is **ON**, you are required to scan your fingerprint every time you want to unlock a _**repository**_ or enter into its **Security screen**. ",
    "faqContent4b2": "If you switch the **biometric protection OFF**, you will still be required to scan your fingerprint when you want to enter the **Security screen**. ",
    "faqContent4b3": "**Biometric protection** of the **Security screen** is deleted only when  **biometric protection** is removed from devices, or when you decide to use the **password** protection instead. ",

    "faqTitle5": "How can I add files and folders to my repository?",
    "faqContent50": "That's easy. Tap on the _**repository name**_.  This will take you to the _**repository**_ contents screen where you will see a **Plus** button: ",
    "faqContent51": "This will open a small window where you can choose whether to create a folder within that _**repository**_ or add files to it",
    "faqContent52": "If you decide to create a **new folder** this dialog box will allow you to do it: ",
    "faqContent53": "Alternatively, you can import files into one of the existing folders. ",
    
    "faqTitle6": "What does it mean to 'import' a repository?",
    "faqContent60": "To import a _**repository**_ means that you want to recreate on your device a _**repository**_ that a peer has [shared](#sharing) with you. ",
    "faqContent61": "You start with the **+** button and then select **Import**:",
    "faqContent62": "Tapping on the **Import repository** button will bring you to this screen:",

    "faqContent64": "After you either copy and paste the **link** you received from your peers or scan the **QR code**, you will see this screen. ",
    "faqContent65": " On this screen, you need to give your imported _**repository**_ a name and decide if you want to make use of the [Ouisync server](#privacy-and-security). You can leave the name the same as the one suggested on the screen, or you can change it. Tapping on the Import button will complete the process of importing a _**repository**_.",
    "faqContent66": "The imported _**repository**_ will appear on your screen and after a short while all its content will be imported into your device.  In other words, the Ouisync _**repositories**_ on your devices will sync their data with the _**Ouisync repositories**_ on your peer’s device.  This will happen automatically, without the need for your to perform any further action. ",
   
    "faqTitle6a": "I have imported a repository - what should I do next?",
    "faqContent6a1": "The first thing to do is to verify that your device is connected with the peer whose _**repository**_ you have imported.", 
    "faqContent6a2": "To do do that, please go to the app **Settings**, and then scroll down to the **Peers** section.  Learn more about [peers and networking](#peers-and-networking).",
    "faqContent6a3": "When your device is connected to your peer's device, data in your respective _**repositories**_ will sync automatically.",
    "faqContent6a4": "As a user, you don't need to perform any additional action to make the syncing start.", 
    "faqContent6a5": "You can monitor the speed of data synchronisation by viewing the upload and dowload speeds to the right of the _**repository**_ name ",

    "faqContent6a7": "If your devices are connected to each other, every time you change the content of the shared _**repository**_, or your peer does, your respective _**repositories**_ will automatically sync with each other. When syncing is complete, you and your peer will have identical data in your respective repositories. ", 
    
    "faqTitle6b": "How can I know when the syncing of my repositories is completed?", 
    "faqContent6b1": "During the syncing, you will see these symbols next to the _**repository**_ name.", 
    "faqContent6b2": " Once the **syncing** is complete, you will see the **green check** icon next to the _**repository name**_. This means that you now have on your device the exact copy of the _**repository**_ that your peer has shared with you.  ",
     
    "faqTitle70": "What are Blind repositories? ",
    "faqContent700": "When sharing a _**repository**_, you can decide to share it with [Blind](#blind) permission.", 
    "faqContent701": "This means that it can be imported into another device and its purpose is simply to securely store data on that device.", 
    "faqContent702": "_Note: if your **blind** _**repository**_ is online at the same time as your other _**repositories**_, it will sync with your original _**repository**_._",
    "faqContent703": "In other words, your **Blind** _**repository**_ will receive any updates that you make to your data.  If you rename, copy move or delete files in your original _**repository**_, they are going to be automatically renamed, copied, moved or deleted in your **Blind** _**repository**_ as well. ", 

    "faqTitle71": " Why is it called Secure Data Storage and  not simply Data Backup? ",
    "faqContent7101": "Typically, if you want to back up your data, the backups would be created by some utility program, and they would be timestamped.  Thus, if you needed to, you would be able to go back to the previous backed up version. ",

    "faqTitle20b": "What happens when I switch the BitTorrentDHT and Peer exchange OFF?", 
    "faqContent20b1": "If these settings are switched off, Ouisync app relies on Local discovery protocol to find peers within your local wi-fi network or use UPnP to connect to other devices.", 
    "faqContent20b2": "UPnP is a service that allows devices on the  same local network to discover each other and automatically connect. This is how smart devices you may have at home connect to routers or each other. ",

    "faqContent20d08": "To do this, you  send them the links or QR codes in the usual way and they import those links or scan the QR codes also in the usual way.  You will then see each other’s IP address in the Peers screen, in the status connected, and underneath it a small label like this.", 
    "faqContent20d09": "If you follow these steps, the DHT will not be aware that you have shared a Ouisync repository with a peer and it will not exchange your IP address with other peers present in the DHT lookup system. ",
    "faqContent20d10": "_Note: If you have previously used Ouisync or other applications that rely on BitTorrent DHT and Peer Exchange for peer discovery and data exchange (which P2P applications often do),then your IP address may be ‘remembered’ by the DHT for awhile even after you stop using those applications._ ",
    "faqContent20d11": "_This means that If you initially share your Ouisync repositories via internet, and you have the BitTorrent DHT ON, DHT may remember that IP address for awhile even if you then switch the BitTorrent DHT setting off and only share your Ouisync within your local network, or directly to a peer’s IP address._",
    "faqContent20d12": "_This ‘remembering’ is a normal feature of the BitTorrent DHT design to speed the peer discovery within the P2P applications. If your IP address becomes inactive within the DHT (ie you don't use any applications that rely on it, for a period of time), eventually the DHT will ‘forget’ your IP address and drop it from its lookup tables._",
    
    "faqTitle20e": "Why can I not connect directly to my peer’s IP address? ",
    "faqContent20e1": "The ability of your device to connect directly to your peer’s device via their IP address depends on many things outside the Ouisync app’s control.  This could be your Internet Service provider, your device’s NAT settings, firewall settings, your router and so on. Depending on these factors, direct device-to-device connection sometimes may not be possible.",
